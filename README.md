# ElderlyCareIOTProject
I made elderly care project during our acadmics course CS321. In this project I am automatically turning off and on heater or AC whichever is required according to the current temperature. I am also alerting elderly persons relative if he falls. I am alerting the elderly person at fixed interval of  6 hours using buzzer and LED. Simulation of heater and AC is done using LEDs. I am also continuously recoding the elder person heartbeat rate. If the heartbeat falls below a range or becomes too high I am sending the alert to his/her relatives.Using pi we send data to server
